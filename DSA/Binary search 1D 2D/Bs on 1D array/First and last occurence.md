Given a sorted array nums and an integer x. Find the floor and ceil of x in nums. The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x. If no floor or ceil exists, output -1.


Example 1

Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 5

Output: 4 7

Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

Example 2

Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 8

Output: 8 8

Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.

### Brute force


```python
class Solution:
    def First_last(self,nums,x):
        first=-1
        last=-1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]==x:
                if first==-1:
                    first=i
                elif first !=-1:
                    last=i
                if last ==-1:
                    last=first
        return [first,last]
print(Solution().First_last([1,2,3,4,5,5],3))
